outdated as of v2

- C++ queues uses push() and pop(), pop() does not return the object, it only removes it from the queue
- #define saves memory over const int (C++ version of final)
- float saves memory over double but can't store as much data
- a method and variable can't have the same name in local reference
- use fabs() for absolute value of float
- use GitHub copilot
